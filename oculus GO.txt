oculus go saving files.

you can create and write to files no problem on a occulus go.
These files will not be visible via usb as the usb uses the MTP protocol.
This protocol uses a list of files to make visible over usb.
These files are visible via a ADB file veiwing software.
to make a file visible via usb you need to update that list with that file uising the native andrtoid media scannerconnection.
This can be done for the whole device, but depending on the file count this is not advised.


Occulus GO and maybe other android devices do not run code in the on (destroy, OnApllicationQuit) functions this took a awhile to over come.
The work around was to add the update file list code to the OnPause function. this is ran when the oculus key is pressed on the remote.
after the code is ran the program cannot writed to that file so the porgram needed to be closed.
